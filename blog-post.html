            <h1>Tyler Rablin on Ditching Old Assessment Systems to Build Student Motivation</h1>
            <p>Frustrated by the narrow lens of traditional grading, this instructional coach and former English teacher redesigned his grade book to encourage authentic student buy-in.</p>

                All the professional development in the world couldn’t prepare Tyler Rablin for postpandemic teaching. Up against students’ cell phones and the personal struggles they brought back into classrooms, he found that it became increasingly difficult to capture their attention, let alone sustain it through an entire class period.
            </p>
            <p> Once-reliable strategies like gamifying lessons or fun takes on formative assessment no longer yielded the same results, as student attention wandered and engagement petered out faster than ever. “It came down to me asking myself: Do students understand that what they’re learning is important?” Rablin recalls. “Do they feel like they’re making progress and can be successful?” Without these important pieces in place, “I was relying on fun and flash, and that wasn’t sustaining students.”</p>
            <p>Through trial and error, Rablin—an instructional coach, consultant, and former high school English teacher based in Washington state—began to clarify what really worked inside his classroom to activate and sustain deep student motivation. His reflections became the foundation of his first book: 
                <em> Hacking Student Motivation: 5 Assessment Strategies That Boost Learning Progression and Build Student Confidence</em>
            </p>
            <blockquote>When I had a student who wasn’t engaged, my first question was, “when was their last win?”</blockquote>
            <p>I recently spoke with Rablin about the harmful messaging students receive from the assessment process, the early-career catalyst that inspired him to overhaul his grading practice, and the small but mighty question that changed how he thinks about student motivation.</p>

                    <p class="comment-text">I love the intent to reframe assessment as communication and not a judgment. 
                        It can be so hard to get students to shift from focusing on the grade to 
                        focusing on learning, especially given the way grades get used as rewards 
                        in upper grades and into college. Thank you, Tyler, for these suggestions!

                    <p class="comment-text">That recalibration of the grade book is such an “ah-ha!” for me. 
                        What a powerful way to help us REALLY see how students are doing in specific areas of 
                        our class. I can see it being really valuable to work on that with other teachers 
                        in the same department, especially at different grade levels — just think 
                        how much better informed students and their families would be if they had that kind of 
                        consistent, specific feedback. This is some great work, Tyler!</p>

                    <p class="comment-text">I had a student who struggled and very rarely engaged. 
                       I gave them an activity that they could do as many times as they wanted 
                       until they got a hundred percent, then it would email them this silly badge. 
                       That student worked so hard at that assignment, and then finally got it. 
                       When they walked outta the classroom that day—oh, I’m tearing up trying 
                       to tell the story—I not very tactfully just asked, “why did you work so hard?” 
                       I realized it was kind of rude because I was saying like you never work hard. 
                       Why did you work so hard? But he just said, “I don’t know, I never get the chance to 
                       get 100%.” Sometimes kids really just need a win and to feel like, you are successful. 
                       You did it! That story stuck with me and really has helped shape how I approach 
                       assessment in the classroom. </p>
