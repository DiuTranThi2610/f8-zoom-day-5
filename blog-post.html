            <h1>Tyler Rablin on Ditching Old Assessment Systems to Build Student Motivation</h1>

                All the professional development in the world couldn’t prepare Tyler Rablin for postpandemic teaching. Up against students’ cell phones and the personal struggles they brought back into classrooms, he found that it became increasingly difficult to capture their attention, let alone sustain it through an entire class period.
            </p>
            <p> Once-reliable strategies like gamifying lessons or fun takes on formative assessment no longer yielded the same results, as student attention wandered and engagement petered out faster than ever. “It came down to me asking myself: Do students understand that what they’re learning is important?” Rablin recalls. “Do they feel like they’re making progress and can be successful?” Without these important pieces in place, “I was relying on fun and flash, and that wasn’t sustaining students.”</p>
            <p>Through trial and error, Rablin—an instructional coach, consultant, and former high school English teacher based in Washington state—began to clarify what really worked inside his classroom to activate and sustain deep student motivation. His reflections became the foundation of his first book: <em> Hacking Student Motivation: 5 Assessment Strategies That Boost Learning Progression and Build Student Confidence</em></p>
            <blockquote>When I had a student who wasn’t engaged, my first question was, “when was their last win?”</blockquote>

            <div class="comment">I love the intent to reframe assessment as communication and not a judgment. It can be so hard to get students to shift from focusing on the grade to focusing on learning, especially given the way grades get used as rewards in upper grades and into college. Thank you, Tyler, for these suggestions!</div>
            <div class="comment">That recalibration of the gradebook is such an “ah-ha!” for me. What a powerful way to help us REALLY see how students are doing in specific areas of our class. I can see it being really valuable to work on that with other teachers in the same department, especially at different grade levels — just think how much better informed students and their families would be if they had that kind of consistent, specific feedback. This is some great work, Tyler!</div>
